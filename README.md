"Do Not Edit" Notice Specification
==================================

Martin Vidner, SUSE

Version 1, January 2013

A Do-not-edit Notice can be found in the first dozen lines of a textual
configuration file. The notice starts on the line containing the string
`DO NOT EDIT` (without quotes) and ends with an empty line.

This notice will be simply displayed as a warning by a tool that helps the
user edit the file. Obviously, one such tool is a text editor. The delimiters
are present to assist other tools (for example YaST) which present the file in
a more structured way.

In most formats of configuration files, the notice will need to be enclosed in
a comment block. Stripping the comment delimiters is not addressed in this
version of the specification.

Example, `/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0`

    # DO NOT EDIT this file, it will be overwritten by Chef every 30 minutes.
    # Instead, edit: git://git.example.com/intranet/ifcfg-eth0.template
    
    STARTMODE=auto
    BOOTPROTO=dhcp
